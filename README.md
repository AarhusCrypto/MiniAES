		     Fast Oblivious AES 
                             -   
       A dedicated application of the MiniMac Protocol

	By Ivan Damgaard And Rasmus Winther Zakarias

	
 In the paper with the title above we present the fastest actively
 secure multi-party computation of the Advanced Encryption Standard to
 date. We take our offset in work from DLT14 (The MiniTrix project).

REPRODUCING OUR EXPERIMENTS:
--------------------

1) Download the code
2) Install required software for building the code
3) Build the code
4) Perform pre-processing generation
5) Start the monitor and Run the MPC peers 

Requirements
----------

 AutoMake 1.14
 GCC compiler suite for C


TODO(rwz): this will be complete shortly.
