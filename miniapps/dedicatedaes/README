                       CHEETAH
                 Fast Multiparty AES


The Cheetah is the fastests land animal in the world accelerates from
0 - 100 km/h in 3 seconds. This implementation is the fastests land
based MPC AES in the world computating 7 blocks of AES in less than 3
milliseconds. Hence the name !

Synopsis:
---------
We take the MiniMac protocol generic version and extend with
four new functions which are AES specific:

SBox(dst_id, op1_id) that takes two heap locations one for the
destination of the operation and the operand to which we apply the
SBox. In this incarnation the SBox is preprocessed and takes opening.

SBox_pol(dst_id, op1_id) that evaluates the S-Box as a polynomial
using bit decomposition triples with six multiplications for one S-Box
evaluation. This is done on all bytes in the operand.

SrMc(dst_id, op1_id) that takes two heap locations one for the result
and one for the sole operand. The code word in the operand is
considered as seven (and a half) AES states. We consume a preprocessed
linear transformation corresponding to the shift-rows and mix columns
tasks in AES.

Sr(dst_id, op1_id) that takes two heap locations one for the result
and one for the sole operand. The code word in the operand is
considered as seven (and a half) AES states. We consume a proprocessed
linear transformation corresponsing only to the shift-rows step in
AES.
